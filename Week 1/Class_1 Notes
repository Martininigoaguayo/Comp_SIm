Finite Difference Methods
- The solution to a differential equation is a function.
- Methods for approximating solutions to partial differential equations.
- FDM uses taylor series expansion
- Error analysis with time complexity.
- FDM's work on regular grids. Can be extended to triangular meshes.

Modelling
 [Real Word -> 
 (idealization) -> Math Model -> 
 (Discretization) -> Numerical Model, has discrete values, can be implemented on a computer -> 
 (Computation) -> Solution -> (Verification with the real world, validation)]
 There is verification between numerical model and math model.
 
Forward finite difference
-Approximate derivative by taking (x_i + x_i+1)/delta x where the x's are measured points.
-You can do the same with second order derivaties.
