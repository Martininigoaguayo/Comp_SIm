Spatial derivaties vs Time based derivates
    - Spatial derivates example: See how the values of a scalar field change, based on their x and y differences.
    - Time derivates, e.g temperature change over time 
    
    
Phi known for a specific point in time (phi(x,y, specific_t ))

U is a given velocity field. We use U to update Phi over time, consider rotating our Phi over time.
