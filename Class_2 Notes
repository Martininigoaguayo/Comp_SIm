Class 2

What is an experiment?
-An experiment takes something as an input (x) and out puts a y.
-The hypothesis doesn't know what happens when x->y
    -The hypothesis needs clear assumptions.
    -Tells us how to measure whether or not the output is correct or not.
Needs to consider noise in the process x->y.
Think about what an experiment could be?
 - Trying different f(x)
 - Try changing the boundary conditions.
 - Try making the grid finer. Keep multiplying delta x by 1/2.
    - Use real world data to verify.

Run simulations against real data.
